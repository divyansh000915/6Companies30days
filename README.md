Program to find Nth Ugly Number.
      6.    Given two strings str1 and str2. We say that str2 divides str1 if it's possible

            to          concatenate multiple str2 to get str1. For example, ab divides abab.

           if str2 does not divide str1, return -1. Otherwise, return the smallest string

           str3 such that str3 divides both str1 and str2.
